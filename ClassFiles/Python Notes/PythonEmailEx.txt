Suppose that all the emails in the inbox are saved in a list, and a Binary File
Write a python script that enables system administrators to count the number of emails about a specific subject

emails = ['ef0','ef1','ef2','ef3']
Bmail['emails'] = emails #Write emails into a binary file 
>>> import shelve, re #Import the Shelve and Regex Modules
>>> bMail= shelve.open('emailIdx')#open the Binary File, and opens, if not exist
>>> list(biFilevalues()) 


>>> topicRegex = re.compile(r'subject:[a-z0-9!$&?,;:\s]*',re.I)#Make a search Regex, to retrieve subject, and save it in topicRegex
>>> topicRegex.findall('''(tEmail[0][1])''') #Email may have multi line, triple quotes help retrieve multiple lines, 
#Will grab 'e0' and 'e1' from bMail, will output subject list


1. import shelve
2. bMail = shelve.open('eIndx')
3. emails = ['e0','e1','e2','e3']
4. bMail['emails'] = emails #Write to binary files
5. bMail.key() #Will output ['emails'] will look like list, but not actually
list(bMail.key()) #Will output ['emails'] in proper list format

6. list(bmail.values()) #Will output [['e0','e1','e2','e3']]

Suppose the dates on which emails were sent are in two formats: yyyy-mm-dd and mm/dd/yyyy. 
Write a python script that enables sys admins to change all sending dates of the emails in the boxes to the format of dd-mm-yyyy
